# Reflex-Based Control for the Hiwonder SpiderPi

Bio-inspired robotic locomotion project focused on implementing a **pure reflex-based control architecture** inside a physical hexapod robot.

Originally developed as a **COLABS research project at Tohoku University** within the Neuro-Robotics laboratory during an academic exchange program, this work later evolved into my **Master’s thesis**.

## Project Summary

This project explores how biological principles — specifically the locomotion mechanisms of the **stick insect** — can be translated into practical robotic control systems.
Instead of relying on computationally heavy centralized planning, the robot is controlled through a decentralized reflex architecture designed to produce adaptive and stable walking behavior.
The control system was implemented and tested on the **Hiwonder SpiderPi**, a Raspberry Pi–powered hexapod platform commonly used for robotics research and motion-control experimentation.

## Why This Project Matters

Legged robots must operate in unpredictable environments where precomputed motion often fails. Biological organisms solve this through local reflex loops rather than global planning.

This research investigates whether:

- Simple reflex rules can generate robust locomotion  
- Bio-inspired control can reduce computational overhead  
- Decentralized architectures improve adaptability
